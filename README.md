# kmonad-sys-tray

A sys tray accompanied with kmonad.  Kmonad is a great keyboard shortcut program that works with X11 and Wayland.  It does a great job as long as you learn its syntax.
I give a sys tray that allows you to choose which keyboard device to use and to start the script with.  It also shows you how to enter different modes you might use.
